A CNN-BASED FRAMEWORK FOR ACCURATE TRAFFIC DETECTION, CLASSIFICATION, AND VOLUME ESTIMATION IN INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS
Overview
This project presents a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based framework designed to:

Detect traffic conditions,

Classify vehicle types, and

Estimate traffic volume
for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) applications.
The model processes real-world traffic data and aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of traffic management systems.

Project Structure
trafficnew.ipynb — Jupyter Notebook containing the complete CNN model pipeline (data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation).

traffic_dataset_large.csv — Traffic dataset used for training and testing.

Features
End-to-end CNN-based traffic detection and classification.

Real-time traffic volume estimation.

Optimized preprocessing techniques for large traffic datasets.

Model evaluation with detailed performance metrics.

Technologies Used
Python 3.10+

TensorFlow / Keras — Deep learning framework.

Pandas — Data manipulation.

NumPy — Numerical computations.

Matplotlib, Seaborn — Data visualization.

OpenCV (if included later for video/image processing)

Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/traffic-detection-cnn.git
cd traffic-detection-cnn
Install required packages: It's recommended to create a virtual environment first.

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Notebook: Open the trafficnew.ipynb notebook using Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells step-by-step.

Dataset: Make sure the traffic_dataset_large.csv file is present in the same directory as the notebook, or update the path accordingly.

Model Architecture
Input Layer

Multiple Convolutional + MaxPooling Layers

Flattening Layer

Dense (Fully Connected) Layers

Output Layer (Softmax Activation for Classification)

The model is tuned for optimal performance on traffic data through techniques like dropout, batch normalization, and adaptive learning rates.

Results
Accuracy: Achieved high accuracy across multiple traffic categories.

Confusion Matrix: Showed strong differentiation between different vehicle types and traffic conditions.

Volume Estimation: Provided near-real-time predictions of traffic volume.

Future Enhancements
Integration with live traffic video feeds (using OpenCV).

Deployment as a web application using Flask/FastAPI.

Optimization for edge devices and IoT integration in smart cities.

Expansion of the dataset for improved generalization.
